# The domobee API

## What is tulip ?
Domobee is an Open Source project with aim to create, using cluster model, an open platform to manage and control beekeeper's hive.


## Why ?
Controlling hives can be painful, especially if the beekeeper has hundreds of beehives in production. Using a remote control system, through a web interface and an API, it is widely possible to have an overall view on its hives and thus to locate the hives in difficulties and to avoid extracting the hives for nothing without having reached the optimum threshold for a better honey extraction.
